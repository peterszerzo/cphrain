## Task 4

Time to get freaky!

Drops should be rendered and animated the same way as before. However, 5% will be moving upwards (you should randomize this one as well).

Remember that you can pass in drops with additional fields, like so:

```js
{
  x: .35,
  y: .2,
  scale: 1,
  blur: 0,
  dir: -1
}
```
