*Copenhagen got rain* is a code-off challenge we're having at the Copenhagen Frontenders meetup on August 2nd, 2016. The format is simple: two 2-person teams are picked at random from a list of volunteers, and will occupy two workstations with a [a codepen link](http://codepen.io/pickled-plugins/pen/NAyOBX) open. The link includes markup with markup, styling and scripts to make the task focused, fun and just a little crazy.

The teams have 10 minutes to complete the exercise, in the company of an enthusiastic audience and some ridiculous music.

Good luck and enjoy - and now, onto the challenge..
