*Copenhagen got rain* is an epic code-off challenge happening at the Copenhagen Frontenders meetup on August 2nd, 2016. Two teams of two programmers each will compete to create a raindrop animation in a series of increasingly difficult tasks. The end result is similar to what you see in the background of this page.

The format is simple: the teams are picked at random from a list of volunteers, and will occupy two workstations with a [codepen link](http://codepen.io/pickled-plugins/pen/NAyOBX) open. The link includes markup, styling and plenty of helper scripts to make the task focused, fun and just a little crazy.

The teams have 15 minutes to complete the exercise, in the company of an enthusiastic audience and ridiculous music. Please ask questions early and often :).

Good luck and enjoy - and now, onto the challenge..
