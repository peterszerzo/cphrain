### Safety first!

`cphrain.js` is very safe and efficient, and does not do cumbersome animating if its inputs are not valid. Therefore, if any of the conditions on the function arguments are not met, your screen will display one of the following very helpful error messages:

* your potatoes are heavenly
* dig og mig i Skagen
* das ist äußerst dunkelblau
* computers are a bunch of corrupt greedy hypocrites
* and so on..

Your solution must run without such error messages.
